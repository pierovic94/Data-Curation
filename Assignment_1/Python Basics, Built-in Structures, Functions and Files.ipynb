Next the for loop look up for every items into a list and it will append the corrisponding letter - lagged by 3 values - into a new empty list *code_ecrypt*. Whenever the loop meet special items - such as white space, comma or exclamation mark - it appends that exact same items and will avoid to break due to KeyError messages.\n",
